uTP /Micro Transport Protocol
-----------------------------

Micro Transport Protocol or ÂµTP (sometimes also uTP) is an open UDP-based variant of the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol intended to mitigate poor latency and other congestion control issues found in conventional BitTorrent over TCP, while providing reliable, ordered delivery.

It was devised to automatically slow down the rate at which packets of data are transmitted between users of peer-to-peer file sharing torrents when it interferes with other applications. For example, the protocol should automatically allow the sharing of an ADSL line between a BitTorrent application and a web browser.

### Class uTP.Server
This class is used to create a uTP server.

#### new uTP.Server(port, [host], [callback])
Begin accepting connections on the specified `port` and `host`.  If the `host` is omitted, the server will accept connections directed to any IPv4 address.  A port value of zero will assign to a random port.

This function is asynchronous.  When the server has been bound, `listening` event will be omitted.  The last parameter `callback` will be added as a listener for the `listening` event.

#### server.close([callback])
Stops the server from accepting new connections and keeps existing connections.  This function is asynchronous.  The server is finally closed when all connections are ended and the server emits a `close` event.  Optionally, you can pass a callback to listen for the `close` event.

#### server.address()
Returns the bound address, the address family name and port of the socket as reported by the operating system.

#### server.unref()
Calling `unref` on a server will allow the program to exit if this is the only active server in the event system.  If the server is already `unref`d, then calling `unref` again will have no effect.

#### server.ref()
Opposite of `unref`.  Calling `ref` on a previously `unref`d server will *not* let the program exit if it's the only server left (the default behavior).  If the server is `ref`d, calling `ref` again will have no effect.

#### Event: `listening`
Emitted when the server has been bound.

#### Event: `connection`
- `Socket Object` The connection object

Emitted when a new connection is made.  `socket` is an instance of `uTP.Socket`

#### Event: `close`
Emitted when the server closes.  Note that if connections exist, this event is not emitted until all connections are ended.

#### Event: `error`
- `Error Object`

Emitted when an error occurs.  The `close` event will be called directly following this event.


### Class uTP.Socket
This object is the abstraction of a uTP/UDP socekt.  `uTP.Socket` instances implement a duplex Stream interface.  They can be created by the user and used as a client (with `connect()`) or they can be created by Node and passed to the user through the `connection` event of a server.

#### new uTP.Socket([options])
Create a new socket object.

`options` is an object with the following defaults:
```javascript
{
    fd: null
}
```
`fd` allows you to specify the existing file descriptor of the socket.

#### socket.connect(port, [host], [connectListener])
Opens the connection for a given socket.  If `port` and `host` are given, then the socket will be opened as a uTP socket.  If `host` is omitted, `localhost` will be assumed. 

This function is asynchronous.  When the `connect` event is emitted, the socket is established.  If there is a problem connecting, the `connect` event will not be emitted; the `error` event will be emitted with the exception.

The `connectListener` parameter will be added as a listener for the `connect` event.

#### socket.setEncoding([encoding])
Set the encoding for the socket as a readable stream.

#### socket.write(data, [encoding], [callback])
Sends data on the socket.  The second parameter specifies the encoding in the case of a string--it defaults to UTF8 encoding.

The optional `callback` parameter will be executed when the data is finally written out--this may not be immediately.

#### socket.end([data], [encoding])
Closes the socket, i.e., it sends a FIN packet.

If `data` is specified, it is equivalent to calling `socket.write(data, encoding)` followed by `socket.end()`.

#### socket.address()
Returns the bound address, the address family name and port of the socket as reported by the operating system.

#### socket.unref()
Calling `unref` on a socket will allow the program to exit if this is the only active socket in the event system.  If the socket is already `unref`d, calling `unref` again will have no effect.

#### socket.ref()
Opposite of `unref`.  Calling `ref` on a previously `unref`d socket will *not* let the program exit if it's the only socket left (the default behavior).  If the socket is `ref`d calling `ref` again will have no effect.

#### socket.remoteAddress
The string representation of the remote IP address.

#### socket.remotePort
The numeric representation of the remote port.

#### socket.localAddress
The string representation of the local IP address the remote client is connecting on.

#### socket.localPort
The numeric representation of the local port.

#### socket.bytesRead
The amount of received bytes.

#### socket.bytesWritten
The amount of bytes sent.

#### Event: `connect`
Emitted when a socket is successfully established.  See `connect()`.

#### Event: `data`
- `Buffer object`

Emitted when data is received.  The argument `data` will be a `Buffer` or `String`.  Encoding of data is set by `socket.setEncoding()`.

Note that the **data will be lost** if there is no listener when a `Socket` emits a `data` event.

#### Event: `end`
Emitted when the other end of the socket sends a FIN packet.

#### Event: `error`
- `Error object`

Emitted when an error occurs.  The `close` event will be called directly following this event.

#### Event: `close`
Emitted once the socket is fully closed.
